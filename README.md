Strategic Summary
How my prompting changed the campaign narrative:
Initially most AI-generated outreach feels like a generic sales pitch that focuses on solutions. My prompting changed this by putting the pain point first. Instead of telling a Pharma COO that we have software I focused on the specific problem of losing money through inventory waste. By using Scarcity idea that we only take two new partners to ensure quality the narrative shifted from us begging for a sale to them applying for an exclusive partnership. This makes the business look like a high-end.
The mindset I bring is that I view AI as a testing lab for different strategies rather than just a writing tool. I don't just send emails I watch the dashboard to see where the problem is happening. If I see that people are opening my emails but not replying to the mail then I don't blame the product I diagnose a Trust Gap. I then use Negative Prompting to avoid any generic and corporate words that usually kills conversation.
